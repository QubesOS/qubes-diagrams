# Qubes OS architecture diagrams

This repository contains various architecture diagrams for Qubes OS.

The diagrams have been made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), a free,
Visio-like software, which can also be downloaded and run off-line as a Chrome
App.

For each diagram, there is a source XML file (which can be opened in the
drawi.io, but likely also in other similar drawing apps), and also a rendered
PNG file.
